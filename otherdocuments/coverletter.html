    <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
 <p> When I first thought about what I wanted to research I was completely lost. I knew I wanted to do something that was more than an English project, and something that would improve my knowledge in computer science. Then, I thought of a concept I went over briefly in my Software Engineering class. I knew most people don't know what goes into developing software. I wanted to give people a better understanding of how difficult it is. </p>
<p> I had a pretty basic idea of the software engineer crisis from my previous class, but what we learned from was written in the 80's and as we all know software has changed significantly since then. After researching into the topic more I learned that the Ariane 5 was less than a decade old and still suffered from basic software problems. I even learned that a bug in Knight Capital Group caused economic problems just a few months ago.</p>
 <p> After I thought up my idea, I started brainstorming ideas to tell a story about the software engineer crisis. I first started out writing a basic research essay with a collage of newspaper clippings. This was boring to me and I feel like I was just forcing myself to write a paper. After talking to some classmates I learned that some were creating website for their projects. This immediately set off a light bulb in my head. While brain storming ideas, I thought of thing that I couldn't put onto a piece of paper such as small programs to explain common software errors. I saw the format my peers were using to create a website, and that they were basically plugging information into a pre-made interface. </p>
 <p> Then I got the idea to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming and create my own website from scratch. This would allow me to add anything I wanted and make the website look how ever I wanted. This project was changed from just an a research project to a project that allows me to gain knowledge that could help me land a career. I have never developed a website before and had to start from scratch, reading, practicing and learning how to implement different aspects of the website. It took me many days of coding, fixings bugs, testing, learning, asking questions. But I keep up with my hard work cause it was enjoyable to me and I knew I was learning valuable skills. These are skills that I can show on my resume and use in my future. I am proud of myself for taking the time to learn a technology instead of taking the easy road and using a pre-made website. Overall, even though I spent long hours for multiple days learning a tough technology I am proud of what I have learned and happy it will be useful to me in the future. </p> 
 <p> One piece of my project that I am disappointed in is my design and genres. Even though I used multiple genres such as HTML, JavaScript, newspaper articles, and reports, I feel I could have been a little more creative thinking of different ways to tell a story. Also, I felt like I could have made a more progressive design for my website. If you look at modern high tech websites they are innovative and unique, but my website looks like it's from the 2000's. No excuse, but I am not the most creative designer, so I mostly followed a pretty basic layout with a few innovations of my own. This could be because of my beginner web developing skills, and because those websites involve a lot more technologies, databases and servers. </p> 
<p> One of the easier parts of this project was the research. I had basic knowledge of the subject before I started my research, so I knew what I needed to research from the start instead of random searches. Also I am taking several seminars this semester that involve researching different computer science topics so I have spent a whole semesters using the research databases and finding information. For the most part I needed to research information about the cases I used, and research new ideas for reducing the software engineering crisis.</p>
<p>I am very happy about this project, I got to research a topic that I plan on pursuing a career in, and I gained information that could help me in my career. I was extremely happy this project gave me incentive to learn a new technology. When searching for jobs I see a lot of jobs that require skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design. These are all in demand and I am very grateful everything in the project fell together and allowed me to gain knowledge not only in research, and computer science, but also how to improve my skill set to make me more valuable to companies. </p>
