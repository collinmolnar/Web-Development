    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <h3>General Solutions</h3>
   <p> Object oriented programming is a concept that has help reduce problems with developing software. This provides concepts such as, abstraction, hierarchical design, and information hiding. All these concepts make programming easier,make it easier to make bug free software, and provide interfaces to make software reuse easier.</p>
   <p> Integrated development environments(IDE) have also made it easier to develope software. This provides an interface for programmers, so find error as they are typing code it also allows programmers to view error even before the code is compiled into a program. A lot of IDE also allow source control to allow programming teams to work together more efficiently. They allow programmers to debug through their code to find bugs, and also allow support to programmers. This makes software engineering more efficient and easier.</p> 
   <p>Software engineering models have also become more popular in recent years. Before programmers would just start writing code with no idea where they were going. With certain models it gives programmers a set of steps to help plan, implement, test, and maintain code. Some examples of these models are the waterfall model, Agile development, Scrum, and the Spiral model, but these are not the only models. Each model is not set in stone and can be changed depending of the software development team. </p>
    <h3>Ariane 5</h3>
    <p>One problem that caused the Ariane 5 failure was software reuse. When used correctly this can save software engineers countless hours from writing software that has already been written. Problem is, reuse needs to be used correctly. The testers of the software for Ariane 5 did not test every situation properly. Although the software that run a space craft is immensely large, everything still needs to be tested for all situations or else things might literally explode.<p>
    <p>Also when designing software, engineers create a requirements analysis. The system that failed in Ariane 5 was not actually need at the time the spacecraft exploded. A proper require analysis would have prevent this system from being active while it is not needed</p>
    <h3>Mars Climate Orbiter</h3>
    <p>The errors in the orbiter are in some ways similar to the Ariane 5. A requirements analysis would have information about what type of measurement are used. Even though separate companies were developing the software separately, they would have the same requirements analysis and they would have known to use the same measurements. </p>
    <p>Communication is also key when designing software. Communication between the developer and client, communication between the developers and testers, everyone who is involved needs a way of communication. </p>
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p> A lot of problems within the software developing community have been changed since the term "Software Engineering Crisis" was used. High-level languages with closely mimic spoken languages have help developers find bugs, understand code, and allow almost anything to be done by a computer. Every day computers are becoming more and more powerful, the software that runs on the systems has become more complex. This make it easier to have bugs in codes. Today, experts have rationalized that major software will never be bug free but with new technology it is causing less concern.
