    <h2>Ariane 5</h2>
    <h2>One of the most famous software bugs<h2> 
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Think a software bug just costs your program to close. The Ariane 5 software bug caused a $370 million dollar to explode. Flight 501 exploded on June 4, 1996 forty seconds into takeoff. All of this could have been fixed by less than 10 lines of computer code[1]. </p>
    <p>To explain the code that caused the explosion you will need a little background information. Ariane 5's predecessor Ariane 4 had a reputation for great success, but the European Space Agency wanted an even better way to launch satellites into orbit. To develop this spacecraft it needs software to control almost everything. It would've of been impossible to create all this code from scratch, so the developers used a technique called reuse and used code from Ariane 4.</p>
    <p> One part of the software that was reused was the inertial reference platform[5]. In lay-mans terms, this calculates the space crafts position in space. Because Ariane 5 created more g-forces than its predecessor, a Ariane 5 created more horizontal acceleration than its code was able to handle causing the failure. </p>
   	<h3> Here is a simple explanation of the code</h3>
    <p> To calculate the space crafts position in space it needed a number called horizontal acceleration. It stored this number on the computer in a variable. The there are many types of variables to hold, integers, natural numbers, strings of text, etc. They held horizontal acceleration in a 32-bit floating point number. Floating point numbers are used to hold real numbers such as 5.467. The spacecraft software tried to convert this floating point number to a 16-bit integer. Which held a smaller amount of data, and could not hold decimal point. This broken conversion caused the aircraft to go into self-destruct mode and cause the explosion[5]. </p>
