  <h2>Mars Climate Orbiter</h2>
  <h3>The Mars Climate orbiter was a huge embarrassment for NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. You won't even believe what kind of a problem caused the failure.</h3>
  <p> The software for the Orbiter could not have been developed by one group or even one company. It was the lack of communication between these parties that led to a simple error. </p>
  <p> The Mars orbiter was created to help learn about the atmosphere and take images of surface features and atmosphere. It used two different types of cameras, and it was intended to orbit Mars to gather information[8]. While it sounds like a simple mission in reality it is very hard to sent a craft from earth and navigate it to orbit another planet. Two companies who worked together to create the software for the Climate Orbiter used different types of measurement for thrust(pound, and newtons). For most people it would be common sense to make sure all measures were measured in the same way, but a simple miscommunication caused the orbiter to fail. </p>
