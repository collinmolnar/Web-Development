    <h2>Patriot Missile</h2>
    <p> The Patriot missile is a very important asset to the United States Army, and armies all over the world. It is a surface-to-air missile used to intercept aircraft, and also other ballistic missiles[11]. It was used heavily during the Persian Gulf war against Iraqi missiles that were fired towards Americans. As you can guess highly technical software is need to have a missile take out another missile or aircraft at multiple times the speed of sound.</p>
    <p>The software problem with the Patriot missile system is that it used several computers that needed to be in sync in order to properly detect and track targets. A software bug caused these computer to slight become out of sync if the system was operating for periods of time, without rebooting. </p>
    <p>On February 25, 1991 in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia a Patriot missile system was ran continuously for over 100 hours. This only caused the systems to be off by a few tenths of a second, but when a Patriot missile flies at MACH 5 this is to a distance of hundreds of meters[10].</p>
    <h3> This software glitch caused the death of 28 Americans.</h3>
